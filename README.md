# <prework-study-guide>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
This project was made in order for myself and other bootcamp students to remember what they learned from the content of the course, whilst also giving a practical and fun foot in the door approach.



- What was your motivation?
My motivation for taking this course and creating the prework-study-guide has been that I as a child used to create websites to host games which I could play without an internet connection, I also have always had a finesse with languages so that web development is a great career for me to get into. I have previously attended and sought out self-learning opportuinities but these have been lacking with the softskills that the industry would require so taking this bootcamp would give me a couple of things, such as the help and support with the ongoing tutoring whilst also giving me the soft skills that are required and finally it keeps me accountable with up to date information from the industry itself and a community that is in the position I aspire to be in. 

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
The reason this project was made was to provide myself and others with a source of foundational knowledge and to help myself from getting overwhelmed having to remember everything at once. 
- What problem does it solve?
The problem that this study guide solves now is that it is a localised file for bootcamp notes all in one place and  it also gives hands on experience. 
- What did you learn?
I learnt the basics of Html, Git , CSS, and Javascript whilst also giving me a drive to succeed.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.


## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.#
